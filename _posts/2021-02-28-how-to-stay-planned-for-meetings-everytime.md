### You need 3 things for a meeting to happen
1. An online event on the calendar - [Create Event]()
2. Things you need to discuss
3. Ofcourse, the person you want to discuss with :P

### Create an Online Meeting Invitation
You could use the Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar or [B-Planned Calendar](https://app.bplanned.com) in order to create an online invite and it will automatically send an email invite to the person you wanted to have.
